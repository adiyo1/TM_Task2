# TM_Task2

i used the examples from the github of the course to do the task. 
the operator "operator++(int num)" is used in the operator "operator+=(1)" and the same for the operator "operator--(int num).
i used void function to the operators that change themself.

in the tests i used the operators to change the graph and after that i checked the functions from task 1 on the changes.
for example- 
i took a positive graph  with a positive circle and used the operator-- to make him a graph with a negative circle and i check the changes.
